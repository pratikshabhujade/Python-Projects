AI-Based Stock Predictor
**Overview**
The AI-Based Stock Predictor uses machine learning to forecast stock prices based on historical data. This project leverages advanced algorithms to analyze past market trends and provide predictions for future stock prices.

**Features**

Predict future stock prices using historical data
Visualize predictions and stock trends
Supports different machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest)
Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE.
Requirements
•Python 3.7+
•TensorFlow 2.x
•NumPy
•Pandas
•Matplotlib
•scikit-learn

**Install the required packages using pip:**

cd ai-stock-predictor

Prepare Your Data Place your historical stock data in a CSV file. The data should include columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

Training the Model
Edit the config.py file to specify the path to your data file and adjust model parameters.

python predict_stock.py --input_path data/new_stock_data.csv
This script will load the trained model and generate predictions, saving them to predictions.csv.

**Code Structure**
train_model.py: Script to train the machine learning model.
predict_stock.py: Script to make predictions using the trained model.
visualize_predictions.py: Script to generate plots for predictions.
config.py: Configuration file to set paths and model parameters.
data/: Directory to store data files.
models/: Directory to store the trained model.
utils.py: Utility functions for data processing and evaluation.
Example Usage
After training the model, you can use the prediction script to forecast stock prices. Here’s an example of how to execute it:
