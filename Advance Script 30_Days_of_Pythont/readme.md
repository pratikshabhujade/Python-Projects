This Python script is designed to automate the process of managing and processing game directories within a specified source directory. The script performs several key operations to streamline the handling of game projects. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of its functionality:

Functionality Overview
Directory Discovery:

The script searches through the source directory to identify all subdirectories containing the word "game" in their names. This is useful for organizing and processing game-related directories without manually filtering them.

Directory Creation:
A new target directory is created where the processed game directories will be copied. This ensures that the original source structure remains unchanged while the target directory is used for further operations.

Directory Copying and Renaming:
Each identified game directory is copied from the source directory to the newly created target directory. During this process, the script removes the "game" suffix from the directory names to maintain a cleaner and more consistent naming convention in the target directory.

Metadata File Creation:
A metadata.json file is generated in the target directory. This file contains essential information about the processed game directories, including:

gameNames: A list of the renamed game directory names.
numberOfGames: The total count of processed game directories.

Go Code Compilation:
For each game directory in the target location, the script searches for Go source code files (with a .go extension). It compiles these files using the go build command. This step prepares the game code for execution, ensuring that each game directory contains compiled binaries ready for use.

Detailed Workflow
1.Finding Game Directories:
2. The script traverses the source directory recursively to locate directories named with the word "game". This search is done at the 3. 3. top level of the source directory, ensuring only relevant directories are processed.
4. Creating Target Directory:

Usage
To execute the script, provide the source and target directories as command-line arguments. The script will handle the rest, from copying directories to compiling code.
