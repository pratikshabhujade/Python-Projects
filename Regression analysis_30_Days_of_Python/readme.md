**Simple Regression Analysis**
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates simple regression techniques applied to stock data. It uses Python libraries to fetch stock data, prepare it, and apply linear regression models.

**Features**
Data Fetching: Retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
Data Preparation: Prepare data for regression analysis.
Simple Linear Regression: Fit a linear regression model to predict stock prices.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
Visualization: Visualize actual vs. predicted prices and residuals.
Prerequisites
Install the required libraries:
bash
pip install yfinance matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

**Usage**
Clone the repository and install the dependencies.
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Simple_Regression_Analysis.ipynb).
Run the cells to fetch data, perform regression, and visualize results.
Outputs
Regression Plots: Visualize actual vs. predicted prices and residuals.
Model Metrics: Evaluate the model using MSE and R-squared.
